# Fractals-in-Haskell

This project was developed as a part of a competion at my University (helped me win the second prize).

All sorts of fractals are developed in this project which are then combined, resulting in a beautiful scenery. This can have many applications, specially for gamedevelopers looking to develop quick background artwork.

Moreover, it also demonstrates the power of Haskell, as the ease with which the code is readable and usable. It was built with the help of Juicy pixels and Rasterfic library in Haskell.

Please take look a deeper look at all the project details in the [presentation file](https://github.com/TGDivy/Fractals-in-Haskell/blob/master/Haskell%20Competition.pdf) in this repository.

## Guidlines on Using the repository.

Note, each of the files act as a class aiming to develop one of the fractal patterns. Finally, all the fractals.hs file combines all them to generate some beautiful images like the one below.

### An Intersting Observation.

Another reason this project is extremely important is, from this we can show that everything in the world could possibly have a patter as the images are realistic, scenic. Note, the random function was used in some places, although you must know that the random function itself is generated from a deeply convoluted formula, hence not being truly random.

This says something very intersting about the world we live in!
